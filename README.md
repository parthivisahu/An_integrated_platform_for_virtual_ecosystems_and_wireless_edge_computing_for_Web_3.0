## 1. Overview

In this section, we provide a high-level introduction to our integrated platform, emphasizing the significance of virtual ecosystems and wireless edge computing for the evolving landscape of Web 3.0. We discuss the primary objectives of the platform and its potential impact on various industries.

## 2. Key Features

Here, we outline the key features of our integrated platform, highlighting the functionalities that set it apart from traditional solutions. These features include but are not limited to:

- Virtual ecosystem creation and management
- Wireless edge computing resource deployment and management
- Real-time monitoring and analytics
- Security and privacy controls
- Integration with existing systems and technologies
- Scalability and flexibility

## 3. Virtual Ecosystems

In this section, we delve into the concept of virtual ecosystems, explaining their definition, significance, and benefits. We discuss the process of building virtual ecosystems, explore use cases across different domains, and emphasize the value they bring to Web 3.0.

## 4. Wireless Edge Computing

Here, we introduce wireless edge computing and highlight its advantages over traditional cloud computing approaches. We explore how wireless edge computing seamlessly integrates with virtual ecosystems, empowering distributed and edge devices to process data efficiently. We showcase relevant use cases to illustrate the potential of this technology.

## 5. Platform Architecture

This section provides an in-depth overview of the platform's architecture, explaining its high-level design, individual components and modules, and the data flow between them. Understanding the architecture will enable users to gain insights into how the platform functions and how its different elements interact.

## 6. Framework

To break the forenamed problems, we’re the first to propose a unified blockchain- semantic ecosystems frame for wireless edge intelligence- enabled Web 3.0. The frame contains six crucial factors to consider the content semantics and exploit Oracle to integrate blockchain and off-chain semantic ecosystems. 

## 7. Methodology
A key requirement for a semantic ecosystem is that all participants (including producers and consumers of semantic 5 information) have the same or similar background knowledge, including semantic entity elements and logical relationships. In order to flexibly connect block-chains and semantic ecosystems, we need to solve the following challenges.
• How can blockchain layer Oracle verifiers be adapted to different semantic requirements?
• How can a static sharding strategy with defined fixed settings meet dynamic semantic requirements when creating multiple shards for Oracle verifiers?
